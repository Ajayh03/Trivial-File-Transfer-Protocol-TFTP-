The ozone layer is a protective region of Earth’s stratosphere that contains 
a high concentration of ozone (O₃) molecules and plays a crucial role in sustaining 
life on the planet. It acts as a natural shield by absorbing most of the Sun’s 
harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, particularly UV-B rays, which can cause skin 
cancer, cataracts, and damage to plants and marine ecosystems. The ozone layer 
is located about 15 to 35 kilometers above the Earth’s surface and is continuously 
formed and broken down through natural chemical processes. However, human activities, 
especially the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting 
substances, have led to the thinning of this layer, resulting in ozone holes in certain regions.
