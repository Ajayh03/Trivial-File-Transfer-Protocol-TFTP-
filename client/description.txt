TITLE : TFTP Server and Client
DESCRIPTION:
This project implements a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) client–server application using UDP socket programming. 
The server runs continuously in the background and handles client requests using UDP communication with unique port numbers.
The application allows the user to choose between GET and PUT operations, where GET is used to download files from the server 
and PUT is used to upload files to the server. The implementation supports both octet mode, which transfers raw binary data 
without modification,and netascii mode, which performs ASCII text conversion to ensure compatibility across different systems.
During file transfer, data is exchanged in fixed-size blocks, and each block is acknowledged to ensure reliable and successful
transmission.
